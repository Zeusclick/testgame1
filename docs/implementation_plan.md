# Cosmic Catch – Implementation Plan

> Rules for the Agent:
> - Treat each lowest-level bullet (T1.1, T1.2, …) as a separate task.
> - In **automatic mode** you are allowed to execute several tasks sequentially in a single run (see .cursorrules for details).
> - Do **not** write Swift code inside this document.

(Shortened here for brevity; it should mirror the detailed plan you approved earlier, with Phases 1–8 and tasks T1.1 … T8.12.)
