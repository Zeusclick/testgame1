## Notes & Guidelines for Editors

- Always read:
  - `docs/project_config.md`
  - `docs/implementation_plan.md`
  - `docs/implementation_state.md`
  before starting a new task.
- Only mark a task as “Completed” when:
  - The main behavior works,
  - The code compiles and runs,
  - There are no known regressions caused by that task.
- If a task needs to be split further, document the split here and update the notes for that task.
